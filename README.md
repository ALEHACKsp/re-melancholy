notes

aimbot's autoshoot "SO" mode is sniper specific, it only autoshoots when the sniper is scoped in and can inflict headshot damage.

for glow to work you must manually set the "glow_outline_effect_enable" convar to 1 (if it's not set to 1 already).

menu's open key is INSERT.

when the menu is active you can use the middle mouse button to drag it around (no need to hover over the menu).

left click - decreases the values of: ints, floats, aliases and/or toggles: bools, tabs.

right click - increases the values of: ints, floats, aliases.

holding the keys will dec/inc values quicker.
